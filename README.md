# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and scripts for deploying and interacting with the contract.

# Getting Started

Try running some of the following tasks:

shell
Copy code
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network sepolia
Folder and File Descriptions
contracts/
This directory contains Solidity smart contracts.

## Wallet.sol: 
The main contract for managing identities and licenses.

## Migrations.sol: 
A contract used by the migration system to track which migrations have been run on the blockchain.

## migrations/
This directory contains migration scripts used to deploy the contracts.

### 1_initial_migration.js: 
The initial migration script.

### 2_deploy_contracts.js: A script to deploy the Wallet contract.

## test/
Contains test scripts for testing the smart contracts.

### wallet.test.js: A test file for the Wallet contract.

## scripts/
Contains scripts for deploying and interacting with the smart contracts.

### deploy.js: Script to deploy the smart contracts using Hardhat.
### interact.js: Script to interact with the deployed smart contracts.

## Configuration and Metadata

### .env: 
Environment variables configuration file for sensitive data like private keys and API endpoints.

### .gitignore: 
Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control.

### hardhat.config.js: 
Configuration file for Hardhat, specifying network settings, Solidity version, and paths.

### package.json: 
Contains project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

### package-lock.json: 
Locks the versions of dependencies installed.

### README.md: 
Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage.

## Explanation of Key Components

### contracts/Wallet.sol
This is the main contract that includes all the logic for managing identities and licenses. It defines the structures, mappings, events, and functions required to store and update user data on the blockchain.

## migrations/
Migration scripts are used to deploy smart contracts to the blockchain. The scripts in this directory use the Hardhat migration framework to ensure that contracts are deployed in the correct order.

## test/
Test scripts written in JavaScript (or TypeScript) using frameworks like Mocha and Chai are used to ensure that the smart contracts behave as expected. These tests can be run using Hardhat's testing tools.

## scripts/
These are utility scripts that help in deploying and interacting with the smart contracts. deploy.js would typically handle deploying the Wallet contract, while interact.js might include functions to interact with the deployed contract, such as adding or retrieving identities and licenses.

### hardhat.config.js
This configuration file is crucial for setting up the Hardhat environment. It includes network configurations (like connecting to the Sepolia testnet), Solidity compiler version, and other settings needed for development and deployment.
